        <h1>Accessibility Statement for EcoOpti</h1>
        <p class="meta-info"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> June 7, 2025</p>

        <p>EcoOpti is committed to ensuring its digital services are accessible to all people, including those with disabilities. We are continuously working in accordance with established standards to improve the user experience and make our site a friendly, clear, and equitable place for everyone.</p>

        <h2>Conformance Status</h2>
        <p>This landing page is <strong>partially conformant</strong> with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines <strong>(WCAG) 2.1 Level AA</strong>. Partial conformance means that while we meet most of the standard's requirements, some areas have not yet achieved full compliance, and we are actively working to address them.</p>

        <h2>Measures Taken to Improve Accessibility</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Assistance:</strong> The UserWay accessibility widget is installed on the site, allowing for personal adjustments to the site's display.</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation Support:</strong> The site fully supports keyboard navigation (using the Tab key), including a "Skip to Content" link and a clear focus indicator on interactive elements.</li>
            <li><strong>Semantic Structure:</strong> Proper use of semantic HTML5 tags (such as main, header, section) and a correct heading hierarchy to assist screen readers.</li>
            <li><strong>Support for Assistive Technologies:</strong> Use of ARIA attributes (such as aria-label and aria-live) in dynamic components to convey clear information to screen readers.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternatives for Visual Content:</strong> Appropriate alternative text (alt) has been added to most significant images on the site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Known Limitations and Our Improvement Efforts</h2>
        <p>We are aware of some accessibility limitations on the site and are making efforts to address them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Complex Animations:</strong> Certain parts of the site contain animations and Canvas elements. We are exploring solutions to add a mechanism that will allow users to reduce or stop motion on the site.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> Occasionally, content added to the page after initial load is not immediately reported to assistive technologies. Our development team is working to ensure that all future content updates include appropriate ARIA notifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Support for Older Browsers:</strong> There may be compatibility issues in outdated browsers, such as Internet Explorer. We recommend using a modern browser for the best experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We conduct ongoing reviews to ensure that any new component added to the site meets the required standards.</p>

        <h2>Feedback and Contact Information</h2>
        <p>Accessibility is an ongoing process. If you encounter a problem, a difficulty, or have a suggestion for improvement, we would be happy to receive your feedback. You can contact us through the following channels, and we are committed to reviewing and addressing every inquiry:</p>
